Microsoft Malware Detection
==============================

Objective:
`````````

To classity the class of given *.byte and *.asm files out of 10 provided classes. 
`````````

Features used:
`````````
* Unigram and bigrams of byte files
* Unigram of ASM files
* Pixel intensity of ASM files
* File sizes
```````````````````

Feature engineering:

`````````
* Converting into unigrams and bigrams of byte files.
* Converting into unigrams of ASM files.
* Pixel intensity.
````````````

Error metric:

`````````
Error metric used is log loss. The goal is to achieve lowest possible log loss. 
`````````````````````````````````
